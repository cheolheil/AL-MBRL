# AL-MBRL

This is a working piece for implementation of PILCO ([Deisenroth et al., 2015](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6654139)) with `scikit-learn`.
There is already an open source code of PILCO for Python, which uses `TensorFlow v2` as a backend ([GitHub link](https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO)).

There are a lot of things must be done in this code (especially, numerical issues), but publicized it for any assitance from anonymous fellows.
